# 1hr Challenge Async Front end
I gave myself one hour to build as much of an async FE as possible. The intent was to play with websockets and eventually
data.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Socket.io
- React Hook Forms
- Tanstack Query
- MUI

The challenge started as soon as I had React and the dependencies installed.

## How to run
This requires
1. Clone the repo
2. Clone this backend repo - https://github.com/leightonvanrooijen/event-vet-be
3. on both codebases
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm start`
Got to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the app running
